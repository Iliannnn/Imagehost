The free-to-use template for your Imagehost-website made with PHP, HTML and CSS!

# Some information before we start

- This repo is only code related, to actually host this 24/7 you have to gain experience elsewhere, because I won't explain anything about this

- I can't assure you that this is the best front-end, but feel free to change it to whatever you want :)

- The PHP version is `7.4`

- I used a bit of Bootstrap for the fancy success and error popups 😏

# Cloning the repo
First you need the code on your computer, of course, you do this as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/Iliannnn/Imagehost-Template
```
*( Installing [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is required )*

Now make sure these files are in your root folder *( C:\Users\YOUR_USER )*

# Test or Development start usage

```
php -S localhost:3000
```
*( Installing [PHP 7.4](https://windows.php.net/download#php-7.4) is required )*

Now open `localhost:3000/Imagehost-Template/home.php` in your browser and you see your page!

*In case you have changed the folder name you need to change `Imagehost-Template` to the name you renamed that folder to.*

# Huhhhhhh, why does this site look so *weird*???
That's right, this is because in config.php you still have to adjust a number of data of your choice, such as the path to your favicon, banner, logo, title and other things!

Fortunately, I've been kind enough to post some information next to each line in comment 🤗

## This is what the page looks like without editing the config.php:

Such a little work, but such a nice result.. Cool isn't it!

> **PS:** I made an images folder for you, maybe you can use it well..

# Explore the website

Just take a look around the website to see how everything works! I am sure you will like it! 😀

# Editing the front-end

Some useful info for editing the pages:
- Every page has its own stylesheet in the `css` folder, just look at the names of the stylesheets and you will understand which page belongs to which page I think!

- Don't change the `php` if you have no experience with this, you are free to use the html, as long as you don't adjust the actions and methods in the forms..

- Delete **NEVER** the `uploads` folder, because this will contain the uploaded images, changing the name is also not a good idea..

- Have fun with this template and make it a nice website!
